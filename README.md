# bitfumes-community-project

To continue the spirit of bitfumes to learn and grow together as a community. This hacktoberfest, we've decided to build something great with the community. We're expecting all the enthusiasts of the bitfumes family to come forward and contribute to build a great project from scratch.

## idea
As we all know that a lot of people have lost their jobs due to COVID-19 and that includes many developers as well and it's not an easy task to get a freelance job on portals available out there, you gotta have a great portfolio to even get spotted let alone getting a contract.

So let's build our own freelance platform that will also serve as your portfolio. It will be open-source and free, "To the people", "By the people", "For the people" :)

In the process, we will learn a lot and get to know each other and enjoy team work
